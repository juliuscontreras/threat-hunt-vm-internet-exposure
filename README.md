# 🛡️ Threat Hunt Project: VM Internet Exposure

## 📌 Objective

Identify misconfigured virtual machines in a shared services cluster that were unintentionally exposed to the public internet. Investigate for any brute-force login attempts and determine if unauthorized access occurred.

---

## 🔍 Hunt Process Overview

### 1. Preparation
- **Goal**: Define scope of the threat hunt.
- **Hypothesis**: Older VMs without account lockout settings may have been exposed to brute-force login attacks.

### 2. Data Collection
- Focused on:
  - `DeviceInfo`
  - `DeviceLogonEvents`

### 3. Data Analysis
- Investigated:
  - High volume of failed logins

  - Correlation between failed and successful attempts.
  - All were normal.

### 4. Investigation
- Mapped findings to MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Analyzed timelines and actor behavior

### 5. Response
- NSGs were hardened
- MFA and lockout policies implemented

### 6. Documentation
- Findings saved in [queries](queries)
- Queries used are in [findings](findings)
- MITRE and Response [documentation](documentation) available

### 7. Improvement
- Identified lack of lockout policy and monitoring as improvement areas.

## 🔐 Key MITRE ATT&CK TTPs

- **T1595** - Active Scanning  
- **T1110** - Brute Force  
- **T1078** - Valid Accounts  
- **T1589** - Identity Gathering

## ✅ Summary

- No brute force successes detected.
- All logons came from the known `labuser` account.
- Mitigation steps applied to prevent future exposures.
